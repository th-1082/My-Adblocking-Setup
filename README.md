# uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to create a selection of curated filters for use with AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, and uBlock Origin.

Note: <strong>These filters, excluding "TH-TLD-And-Domains.txt", primarily block web elements that I deem to be unnecessary or annoying. <em>Ads are not the focus of these lists.</em></strong>

Keep in mind, most of these blocks are things <em>I don't want to see</em> but others may want to see. Please look through the lists to decide which one(s) will suit your needs.

Note that I will <strong>not</strong> remove anyting from these lists, unless a filter is broken or unnecessary, but I will take suggestions for additions or revisions to the filters. However, I will remove filters that were suggested to me if the filter breaks things or doesn't work. If I receive enough requests to add additional filters, I may move all of them to a sort of "community filters" file.

The filter lists aren't large, they're actually quite small, but they are specific in what they block.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will try to update at least one list per week.
