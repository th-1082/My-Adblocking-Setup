# Welcome to My-uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to give myself a way to store and access my custom filter lists.

<strong>ATTENTION:</strong> Please send all domains that you find in spam emails and spam texts and I will add them to the sketchy domains file. My hope is that that particular list can protect people from spams and phishing. Thank you for your participation and contribution.
<strong>FORMAT:</strong> Just send the domain, i.e. sketchysite.biz

<strong>LIST USAGE:</strong>
"TH-Assorted-Filters" - Contains random annoyance-centered filters for random websites that I use. This list needs to be expanded to be useful.

"TH-Sketchy-Domains" - Contains known scam and malware domains in addition to sketchy looking websites. Additionally, this list contains sketchy domains that I have received in spam texts/emails. <em>Please send me spam domains you receive.</em>

"TH-TLD-List" - This is a rather "brute force" list and contains <em>many</em> TLDs that are not com, net, edu, etc. This list primarily contains foreign TLDs and odd TLDs like ".creditcard" and ".ninja". Use at your own risk.

"TH-YouTube-ASMR-Filters" - This list blocks ASMR videos that I find to be annoying (mostly just eating/mukbang). They are hidden from search results and the sidebar. List is highly inefficient and should not be used until I get some time to revise it. Use at your own risk.

"TH-YouTube-Content-Filter" - This list block bad YouTube content such as highly clickbait channels (i.e. 5 Minute Crafts) and awful text to speech Reddit reading videos (This is most of the list)

"TH-YouTube-Dumb-Comment-Filter" - This list blocks terrible YouTube comments such as "EDIT: Thx for the like guyes!!11!" and "Whos waching in 20xx?". This list is <strong>incomplete</strong> and needs work. Use at your own risk.

"TH-YouTube-Filters" - This list blocks YouTube elements that are just annoying such as end cards and buttons that I don't use or want to use.

Note that I will <strong>not</strong> remove anyting from these lists, unless a filter is broken, unnecessary or is a duplicate, but I will take suggestions for new filters or changes to existing filters. The only filters that I will remove are those that were suggested to me if those filters don't work or are redundant.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will try to update at least one list every couple months or so depending on how busy I get. Know that I will not, at least for the forseeable future, stop updating these lists since I personally use them across all of my uBlock installations. If you encounter an issue with a filter, please submit it as an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
