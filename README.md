# uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to create a selection of curated filters for use with AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, and uBlock Origin.

Keep in mind, most of these blocks are things I don't want to see but others may want to see. Please look through the lists to decide which one(s) will suit your needs.

Note that I will not remove anyting from the lists, unless it doesn't work, but I will take suggestions for additions or revisions to the filters.

The filter lists aren't large, they're actually really small, but they are specific in what they block.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I try to update at least one list once per week.
