# Welcome to My-uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to give myself a way to store and access my custom filter lists.

<strong>ATTENTION:</strong> Please send all domains that you find in spam emails and spam texts and I will add them to the sketchy domains file. My hope is that that particular list can protect people from spams and phishing. Thank you for your participation and contribution.
<strong>FORMAT:</strong> Just send the domain, i.e. sketchysite.biz

Note: <strong>These filters, excluding "TH-TLD-List.txt", primarily block web elements or non-advertising content that I deem to be unnecessary or annoying. <em>Ads are not the primary focus of these lists.</em></strong> I will include advertisement filters if an ad or ad placeholder slips past uBlock.

Keep in mind, most of these blocks are things I wanted to block. <strong>These filters may have adverse effects</strong> for others because I only made them to suit my needs and they are hardly categorized. The only reason they are here is because I needed a convenient way to store and distribute the filter lists to all of my uBlock installations automatically.

Note that I will <strong>not</strong> remove anyting from these lists, unless a filter is broken, unnecessary or is a duplicate, but I will take suggestions for new filters or changes to existing filters. The only filters that I will remove are those that were suggested to me if those filters don't work or are redundant.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will try to update at least one list every couple months or so depending on how busy I get. Know that I will not, at least for the forseeable future, stop updating these lists since I personally use them across all of my uBlock installations. If you encounter an issue with a filter, please submit it as an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
