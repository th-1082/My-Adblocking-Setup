# My-uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to give myself a way to store and access my custom filter lists.

Note: <strong>These filters, excluding "TH-TLD-And-Domains.txt", primarily block web elements or non-advertising content that I deem to be unnecessary or annoying. <em>Ads are not the focus of these lists.</em></strong> I will include advertisement filters if an ad or ad placeholder slips past uBlock.

Keep in mind, most of these blocks are things I wanted to block. <strong>These filters may have adverse effects</strong> for others because I only made them to suit my needs and they are hardly categorized. The only reason they are here is because I needed a convenient way to store and distribute the filter lists to all of my uBlock installations automatically.

Note that I will <strong>not</strong> remove anyting from these lists, unless a filter is broken or unnecessary, but I will take suggestions for additions or revisions to existing filters. However, I will remove filters that were suggested to me if the filter breaks things or doesn't work properly.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will try to update at least one list per week.
