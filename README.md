# My-uBlock-Filters
The goal of this repository is to give myself a way to store and access my custom filter lists.

Note: <strong>These filters, excluding "TH-TLD-And-Domains.txt", primarily block web elements or non-advertising content that I deem to be unnecessary or annoying. <em>Ads are not the focus of these lists.</em></strong> I will include advertisement filters if an ad or ad placeholder slips past uBlock.

Keep in mind, most of these blocks are things I wanted to block. <strong>These filters may have adverse effects</strong> for others because I only made them to suit my needs and they are hardly categorized. The only reason they are here is because I needed a convenient way to store and distribute the filter lists to all of my uBlock installations automatically.

Note that I will <strong>not</strong> remove anyting from these lists, unless a filter is broken or unnecessary, but I will take suggestions for new filters or changes to existing filters. The only filters that I will remove are those that were suggested to me if those filters don't work or are redundant.

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will try to update at least one list per week. If you encounter an issue with a filter, please submit it as an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.

# Note to Community
I am waging an all-out war against <strong>text to speech Reddit videos on YouTube</strong>. These videos are just plain lazy and it drives me insane when they appear in my recommended. I need as many people to help with this project as possible. 

Please submit the names of any channels that match this criteria and I will add them to the content filter list with <em>free same day shipping!</em>
