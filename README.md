# Welcome to My Adblocking Filter Repository
This repository is used to give myself a convenient way to store and access my custom filters for uBO and my Pihole setup.

# General Information
Since these filters were created for myself to use, I will not remove any filters that negatively impact those that use them unless I feel as though they aren't worth keeping. <em>Use these filters at your own risk</em>

The "Hosts" folder contains hosts-formatted files that work with Pihole, but it can also be used with browser-based adblockers. The "UBO & ABP" folder contains many more filter lists and work well with browser based adblockers.

# Lists and Their Purposes
<strong>1.</strong> "TH-Assorted-Filters" - Contains a varying assortment of annoyance-centered filters in addition to a few ad placeholders that don't get removed on occasion. This list needs for fiters to be of much use.

<strong>2.</strong> "TH-Sketchy-Domains" - Contains known scam/malware domains in addition to other sketchy and "unsavory" domains. This also contains domains that I have received in spam text messages that I receive, courtesy of the previous owner of my phone number. <em>If you receive any spam messages with dodgy links, please send them in and I will add them to this list</em>.

<strong>3.</strong> "TH-Country-TLD-List" - This is a rather "brute force" list and contains <em>many</em> non-U.S. TLDs that are not com, net, edu, etc. This list also contains a massive collection of variations of these TLDs to maximize effectiveness. These variations include ".ru.com" or ".com.de". Use this list at your own risk. <strong>I WILL NOT OVERRIDE OR REMOVE ANY FALSE POSITIVES THAT COME FROM THIS LIST.</strong>

<strong>4.</strong> <del>"TH-Odd-TLD-List" - This list contains odd, atypical TLDs such as ".download", ".ninja", and ".creditcard". Due to the heavy usage of these domains by malware distributors and the lack of usage by legitimate websites, this list will outright block many websites that don't end in com, net, edu, org, or gov for the most part. Use this list at your own risk. <strong>I WILL NOT OVERRIDE OR REMOVE ANY FALSE POSITIVES THAT COME FROM THIS LIST.</strong></del>

<strong>5.</strong> "TH-YouTube-ASMR-Filters" - This list blocks ASMR videos that I find to be annoying (mostly just eating/mukbang). They are hidden from search results and the sidebar. <strong>List is highly inefficient and should not be used until I get some time to revise it. Use at your own risk.</strong>

<strong>6.</strong> "TH-YouTube-Content-Filter" - This list block bad YouTube content such as highly clickbait channels (i.e. 5 Minute Crafts) and awful text to speech Reddit reading videos (This is most of the list)

<strong>7.</strong> "TH-YouTube-Dumb-Comment-Filter" - This list blocks terrible YouTube comments such as "EDIT: Thx for the like guyes!!11!" and "Whos waching in 20xx?".

<strong>8.</strong> "TH-YouTube-Filters" - This list blocks YouTube elements that are just annoying or useless such as end cards and buttons that I don't use or want to use (such as miniplayer and cast).

# Additional Notes
I created these filter lists to satisfy my needs. These lists are only public because it would be too much of a hassle to distribute and sync files in a private repo to all of my uBlock installations. If you encouter a problem with a filter or list, I will look into it and if I feel as though a problem does exist, I will resolve it. Note that some of these filters may adversely affect web page content, so <em>use them at your own risk</em>.

I will not remove anything from the lists unless it is broken, redundant, or is a duplicate entry. However, feel free to suggest additional filters or modifications to existing filters. If suggested filtesr don't work, are redundant, or bog down performance, they will not be added. 

Feel free to use any of the lists, I will <em>try</em> to update at least one list every couple months or so depending on how busy I get. Know that I will not, at least for the forseeable future, stop updating these lists since I personally use them across all of my uBlock installations, as well as my Pihole setup. If you encounter an issue with a filter, please submit it as an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.

<strong>Buckle up and enjoy the ride.</em>
